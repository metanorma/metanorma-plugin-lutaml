== Usage with EXPRESS

=== General

The LutaML plugin supports working with EXPRESS schema files to render EXPRESS
models and definitions.

LutaML supports accessing EXPRESS models via the
https://github.com/lutaml/expressir[Expressir] parser.


=== Document attribute `:lutaml-express-index:`

This attribute allows specifying one or more EXPRESS files to defined names
for later use with `lutaml_express` command.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
:lutaml-express-index: shortname_of_index; name_of_schemas_listing_file.yml;
----

Where:

`shortname_of_index`:: is name of the parsed EXPRESS files context for the later
use.

`name_of_schemas_listing_file.yml`:: location of the YAML index file to parse
all EXPRESS files listed within.


[example]
.Define an index in the document and use it in the `lutaml_express` command
====
[source,adoc]
-----
:lutaml-express-index: my_custom_name; /path/to/schemas.yml

[lutaml_express,my_custom_name,context]
----
{% for schema in context.schemas %}
== {{schema.id}}

{% for entity in schema.entities %}
=== {{entity.id}}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
-----

Where the `schemas.yml` file contains:

[source,yaml]
----
---
schemas:
  action_schema:
    path: "../../schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp"
  application_context_schema:
    path: "../../schemas/resources/application_context_schema/application_context_schema.exp"
----
====


=== Schemas listing file

The schemas listing file is a YAML file that lists all EXPRESS files to be
parsed. The file should have the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
---
schemas:
  schema_name:
    path: path/to/schema_file.exp
  schema_name_2:
    path: path/to/schema_file_2.exp
----

Where:

`schema_name`:: is the name of the EXPRESS schema.

`path`:: (optional) path to the EXPRESS schema file. When the path is not
specified, the command will look for the schema file in the directory where the
YAML file is located using the filename pattern `{schema_name}.exp`. The path
can be relative to the YAML file or an absolute path.


=== Usage of the `lutaml_express` command

Given an `example.exp` EXPRESS file with content:

[source,exp]
----
SCHEMA test_schema 'test';

(* Need select elements for measure_value *)
 REFERENCE FROM measure_schema
   (measure_value);

  TYPE my_type1 = EXTENSIBLE SELECT;
  END_TYPE;

  TYPE my_type2 = EXTENSIBLE ENUMERATION;
  END_TYPE;

  TYPE my_type3 = EXTENSIBLE ENUMERATION;
  END_TYPE;

  TYPE my_type4 = EXTENSIBLE ENUMERATION;
  END_TYPE;

  TYPE my_type5 = EXTENSIBLE ENUMERATION;
  END_TYPE;
END_SCHEMA;
----

And the `lutaml_express` block:

[source,adoc]
-----
[lutaml_express_liquid,example.exp,my_context]
----
{% for schema in my_context.schemas %}
== {{schema.id}}

{% for entity in schema.entities %}
=== {{entity.id}}
{% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
----
-----

NOTE: The `lutaml` command can auto-detect the EXPRESS schema file type by the
file extension. If the file extension is `.exp`, the command will use the
`Expressir` parser to parse the file. If the file extension is `.lutaml`, the
command will use the `Lutaml` parser to parse the file.

Where:

* content within the block is called the "`template`";

* `{example.exp}` is the location of the EXPRESS schema file (`*.exp`) that
contains data to be loaded. Location of the file is computed relative to the
source directory that `[lutaml_express_liquid]` is used (e.g., if
`[lutaml_express_liquid,example.exp,my_context]` is invoked in an `.adoc` file
located at `/foo/bar/doc.adoc`, the data file is expected to be found at
`/foo/bar/example.exp`);

* `{my_context}` is the name where the EXPRESS Repository read from the `.exp`
file can be accessed with.

** The `context` object is a serialized `Expressir::Model::Repository` object
with all variable names available. See
https://github.com/lutaml/expressir[Expressir] docs for reference.
`{my_context}` has `schemas` method to access Expressir
https://github.com/lutaml/expressir/blob/master/lib/expressir/model/schema.rb[schemas]

Will produce this output:

____
== test_schema

=== my_type1
=== my_type2
=== my_type3
=== my_type4
=== my_type5
____


Instead of using the direct path to the file one can use `:lutaml-express-index:`
document attribute to supply directory with express files or YAML index file to
parse as well as the cache file location.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
:lutaml-express-index: my_custom_name; dir_or_index_path[; cache=cache_path]
----

Where:

`my_custom_name`:: is name of the parsed EXPRESS files context for the later
use with lutaml command

`dir_or_index_path`:: location of directory with EXPRESS files or path to the
YAML index file to parse

`cache_path`:: (optional) location of the Expressir cache file to use

Example of usage:

[source,adoc]
-----
= Document title
Author
:lutaml-express-index: index_name; /path/to/express_files; cache=/path/to/cache_file.yaml

[lutaml_express_liquid,index_name,context]
----
{% for schema in context.schemas %}
== {{schema.id}}
{% endfor %}
----
-----

* The `lutaml_express_liquid` macro processes the EXPRESS files specified by
  the `index_name` and makes them available in the `context` as
  Liquid Drops object.

* The Liquid template inside the macro block iterates over the `schemas` in
  the `context` and renders the attributes of each schema such as `id`.

=== Using `config_yaml`

This functionality allows `[lutaml_express_liquid]` blocks to load a full set of
EXPRESS schemas in one index, and then provide a select ("filter") option
per-block via a separate YAML file.

[source,adoc]
-----
:lutaml-express-index: all_schemas; ../schemas_all.yaml;

[lutaml_express_liquid,all_schemas,context,config_yaml=schemas.yaml]
---
{% assign all_schemas = repo.schemas  %}
{% render "templates/resources/schema" for ordered_schemas as schema %}
----
-----

Where `schemas_all.yml` provides all schemas:

[source,yaml]
----
---
schemas:
  action_schema:
    path: "../../schemas/resources/action_schema/action_schema.exp"
  application_context_schema:
    path: "../../schemas/resources/application_context_schema/application_context_schema.exp"
  approval_schema:
    path: "../../schemas/resources/approval_schema/approval_schema.exp"
...
----

And `schemas.yaml` only selects 2 schemas:

[source,yaml]
----
---
schemas:
  action_schema:
    anything: ...
  application_context_schema:
    anything: ...
----

The resulting block adds the `ordered_schemas` context to allows you to filter
out the schemas you want to render according to the order in the config_yaml.

[source,liquid]
----
[lutaml_express_liquid,schemas_1,repo,config_yaml=select.yaml]
---
{% assign all_schemas = repo.schemas  %}
{% render "templates/resources/schema" for ordered_schemas as schema %}
...
---
----

NOTE: This functionality is used in the ISO 10303 SRL to load the full schema
set at once but only render the selected schemas in individual documents.

=== Using `include_path`

This functionality allows `[lutaml_express_liquid]` blocks to load templates
from the paths other than the location of the document.

[source,adoc]
-----
:lutaml-express-index: all_schemas; ../schemas_all.yaml;

[lutaml_express_liquid,all_schemas,context,config_yaml=schemas.yaml,include_path=../templates]
---
{% assign all_schemas = repo.schemas  %}
{% render "templates/resources/schema" for ordered_schemas as schema %}
...
----
-----

The resulting block adds the `include_path` to the Liquid renderer.  The path is
resolved based on the location of the document.  You can add multiple paths by
separating them with commas.
