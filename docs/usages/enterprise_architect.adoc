== Usage with Enterprise Architect (UML in XMI)

=== General

The LutaML plugin supports working with Enterprise Architect exported XMI files
to render UML diagrams and class definitions.

The commands are prefixed as `lutaml_ea_*` to denote their specific use with
Enterprise Architect XMI files.


=== Document attribute `:lutaml-xmi-index:`

This attribute allows specifying one or more XMI files to define names
for later use with `lutaml_ea_*` commands.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
:lutaml-xmi-index: index_name; index_path[; config=config_path]
----

where:

`index_name`:: name of index
`index_path`:: path to XMI file for the later use with `lutaml_ea_*` command
`config_path`:: optional, location of YAML configuration file that specifies
what packages to include in the render, what render style is desired and
location of the root package.


[example]
.Define two indexes in the document and use them in the `lutaml_ea_xmi` command
====
[source,adoc]
----
:lutaml-xmi-index: first-xmi-index; /path/to/first.xmi
:lutaml-xmi-index: second-xmi-index; /path/to/second.xmi; config=/path/to/config.yml

[lutaml_ea_xmi,index=first-xmi-index]
--
...
--

lutaml_ea_diagram::[name="NameOfDiagramInSecondXmiIndex",base_path="./xmi-images",format="png",index="second-xmi-index"]
...
----

The command `lutaml_ea_xmi` will load the XMI file from the path
`/path/to/first.xmi` which is specified by the `index`: `first-xmi-index`.

The command `lutaml_ea_diagram` will load the XMI file from the path
`/path/to/second.xmi` which is specified by the `index`: `second-xmi-index`.
====


=== Rendering an Enterprise Architect diagram from XMI: `lutaml_ea_diagram`

This command allows you to quickly render a LutaML diagram as an image file by
specifying the name of the diagram.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
lutaml_ea_diagram::[{options}]
----

where `{options}` is a hash of options, where:

`name`:: (mandatory) name of the diagram to render.
`base_path`:: (mandatory) base path where the diagram images are located.
`format`:: (optional) format of the image file. Defaults to `png`.
`index`:: (optional) index name of the XMI file. If the index is not provided,
the command will look for the diagram in the first XMI file specified through
the `lutaml_ea_xmi` command.
`package`:: (optional) name of the package which contains the diagram. If the
package is not provided, the command will look for the diagram across all
packages in the XMI file.

The diagram with name `name_of_diagram` will be converted into the following
Metanorma block:

[source,adoc]
----
[[figure-{{ diagram.xmi_id }}]]
.{{ diagram.name }}
image::{{ image_base_path }}/{{ diagram.xmi_id }}.{{ format | default: 'png' }}[]
----

[example]
.Specifying a diagram within an XMI file
====
[source,adoc]
----
lutaml_ea_diagram::[name="name_of_diagram",base_path="/path/to/xmi-images",format="png"]
----

Renders the diagram with name `name_of_diagram` from the XMI file in PNG format,
where the EA images exported with the XMI file are at `/path/to/xmi-images`.
====

[example]
.Specifying a diagram within a specific package (if there are multiple diagrams with the same name)
====
[source,adoc]
----
lutaml_ea_diagram::[name="DiagramName",package="PackageA",base_path="/path/to/xmi-images"]
----

The search will be restricted to the diagrams named `DiagramName` in the
`PackageA` package.
====

[example]
.Specifying a diagram using a specific index
====
[source,adoc]
----
:lutaml-xmi-index: index_name; /path/to/xmi-file.xmi

...

lutaml_ea_diagram::[name="name_of_diagram",base_path="/path/to/xmi-images",format="png",index="index_name"]
----

Renders the diagram with name `name_of_diagram` from the XMI file in PNG format,
where the EA images exported with the XMI file are at `/path/to/xmi-images` and
the XMI file defined in the index `index_name`.
====



=== Generating a class definition table for a class: `lutaml_klass_table`

This command allows you to render a LutaML table of a class by using Liquid Drop.

The table will show:

* Class Name
* Class Definition
* Inherited Properties
* Self-defined Properties
* Properties Inherited from Association
* Properties Defined in Association

[source,adoc]
----
lutaml_klass_table::/path/to/example.xmi[name="NameOfClass",template="/path/to/templates/_my_klass_table.liquid"]
----

The command accepts the options listed below:

* `/path/to/example.xmi` specifies the path of the XMI file.

* `name` option only, `name` option with `package` option or `path` option.
  One of 3 forms of options can be used to specify the name of the class.

** `name="NameOfClass"` specifies the name of the `class`.
   (e.g. `name="Building"`)
   If there are multiple classes with the same name, other forms of options
   are recommended to specify the class.

** `package="NameOfPackage",name="NameOfClass"` specifies the name of the
   `class` (specified by `name` option) inside the `package`
   (specified by `package` option).
   The `package` option must be used with the `name` option.
   (e.g. `package="uro",name="_BoundarySurface"`)

** `path="PathOfClass"` specifies the `absolute` path of the `class`
   which starts with `::`
   (e.g. `path="::EA_Model::Conceptual Models::i-UR::Urban Planning ADE 3.
   1::uro::_BoundarySurface"`)
   or `relative` path of the `class` which does not start with `::`
   (e.g. `path="uro::_BoundarySurface"`).
   The last part of the path separated by `::` is the name of the `class`.
   The other parts of the path are the names of the `packages`.

* `template="/path/to/templates/_my_klass_table.liquid"` specifies the path of
  the liquid template. (Optional)
  By default, it will look for the template `_klass_table.liquid` defined in
  `lib/metanorma/plugin/lutaml/templates`.  This template can be customized by
  changing the template path in the `template` option.

* `guidance="/path/to/my_guidance.yml"` specifies the path of
  the yaml file of the guidance. (Optional)

The guidance file should be in the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
---
classes:
  - name: Name Of Class
    attributes:
      - name: Name Of Attribute (e.g. gml:boundedBy)
        used: false
        guidance: |
          Drop guidance message here.
...
----

If you want to define the guidance, you can define the `name` of the class
under `classes`.  Then define which `attributes` you want to add guidance by the
`name`. Set `used` to show the attribute is used or not. Drop the message of
guidance in `guidance`.


=== Generating a definition table for an enumeration: `lutaml_enum_table`

This command allows you to render a LutaML table of a class by using Liquid Drop.

The table will show:

* Enumeration Name
* Enumeration Definition
* Subtype of superclass
* Enumeration Stereotype
* Enumeration Values
** Code
** Value
** Definition

[source,adoc]
----
lutaml_enum_table::/path/to/example.xmi[name="NameOfEnum",template="/path/to/templates/_my_enum_table.liquid"]
----

The command accepts the options listed below:

* `/path/to/example.xmi` specifies the path of the XMI file.

* `name` of the name of the enumeration.

* `template="/path/to/templates/_my_enum_table.liquid"` specifies the path of
  the liquid template. (Optional)
  By default, it will look for the template `_enum_table.liquid` defined in
  `lib/metanorma/plugin/lutaml/templates`.  This template can be customized by
  changing the template path in the `template` option.


=== Usage of `lutaml_ea_xmi` command

The `lutaml_ea_xmi` command performs the same function as the
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command starting from version 0.7.21.

This command renders data model packages and their dependent objects for the supplied
XMI file, by using Liquid Drop objects.

NOTE: The performance of `lutaml_ea_xmi` exceeds
`lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` by 10~20 times when tested with a 10.6MB XMI
file with 120,000+ lines using version 0.7.20 of the plugin.

NOTE: To migrate to this command from `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description`, just
replace the command `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` by `lutaml_ea_xmi`.

Replace:

[source,adoc]
----
[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description, path/to/example.xmi]
...
----

By:

[source,adoc]
----
[lutaml_ea_xmi, path/to/example.xmi]
...
----

You can define guidance in the configuration file as well. The configuration
file will look like:

[source,yaml]
----
packages:
- my_package
guidance: "path/to/guidance.yaml"
----

The guidance file should be in the following format:

[source,yaml]
----
---
classes:
- name: "NameOfClass"
  attributes:
  - name: Name Of Attribute (e.g. gml:boundedBy)
    used: false
    guidance: |
      Drop guidance message here.
...
----

If you want to define the guidance, you can define the `name` of the class
under `classes`.  Then define which `attributes` you want to add guidance by the
`name`. Set `used` to show the attribute is used or not. Drop the message of
guidance in `guidance`.

The `name` of the class can be defined in the following ways:

* `name: "NameOfClass"` specifies the name of the `class`.
  (e.g. `name: "Building"`)
  If there are multiple classes with the same name, it is recommended to
  specify the class by absolute path.

* `name: "::NameOfPackage::NameOfClass"` specifies the name of the `class` in
  `absolute` path.
  (e.g. `name: "::EA_Model::Conceptual Models::CityGML2.0::bldg::Building"`)


=== Usage of `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command

This command allows you to quickly render data model packages and their dependent
objects for the supplied XMI file.

Given an Enterprise Architect `example.xmi` file with 2 packages:

* 'Another'
* 'CityGML'

The `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command can be used:

[source,adoc]
----
[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description, path/to/example.xmi]
--
[.before]
....
my text
....

[.diagram_include_block, base_path="requirements/", format="emf"]
....
Diagram text
....

[.include_block, package="Another", base_path="spec/fixtures"]
....
my text
....

[.include_block, base_path="spec/fixtures"]
....
my text
....

[.before, package="Another"]
....
text before Another package
....

[.after, package="Another"]
....
text after Another package
....

[.after, package="CityGML"]
....
text after CityGML package
....

[.after]
....
footer text
....
--
--
----

Where:

* `path/to/example.xmi` - required, path to the XMI file to render

* `[.before]` - block text that adds additional text before the rendered output, can be used only once, additional occurrences of the command will overwrite text, note that `literal` block style must be used there (e.g. `....`)

* `[.after]` - block text that adds additional text after the rendered output, can be used only once, additional occurrences of the command will overwrite text

* `[.after, package="Another"]` - block text to be inserted after the package (before in case of `.before` name)

* `[.package_text, position="after", package="Another"]` - include custom adoc code into the package rendered body, `position` is a required attribute which tells where to insert the code.

* `[.package_text, package="Another"]` - same as above, but the include block will be included only for the supplied package name

* `[.diagram_include_block]` - block text to automatically include diagram images. Attribute `base_path` is a required attribute to supply the path prefix where to look for a diagram image. `format` is an optional attribute that tells what file extension to use when including the diagram file.
+
The logic is as follows:
[source,adoc]
----
{% for diagram in package.diagrams %}
[[figure-{{ diagram.xmi_id }}]]
.{{ diagram.name }}
image::{{ image_base_path }}/{{ diagram.xmi_id }}.{{ format | default: 'png' }}[]

{% if diagram.definition %}
{{ diagram.definition | html2adoc }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
----

For instance, the script will take package diagrams supplied in the XMI file and will try to include `image` with the name equal to the diagram's xmi_id attribute plus `.png`. Also one can add any text to the command text, it will be added as paragraph before each image include.

* `[.diagram_include_block, package="Another"]` - same as above, but the diagram will be included only for the supplied package name

* `[.include_block, base_path="spec/fixtures"]` - command to include files (`*.adoc` or `*.liquid`) for each package name. Attribute `base_path` is a required attribute to supply the path prefix where to look for file to include. The command will look for a file called `base_path` + `/` `_package_name`(downcase, replace : -> '', ' ' -> '_') + `.adoc`[`.liquid`], e.g. for package 'My Package name' and `base_path` eq to `my/path`, the command will look for the following file path: `my/path/_my_package_name.adoc`.

* `[.include_block, package="Another", base_path="spec/fixtures"]` - same as above, but the include block will be included only for the supplied package name


NOTE: .after, .before, package_text and include_block commands all can be used with additional option - `liquid`, if this option is supplied then the code inside block will be interpolated in liquid context


=== Referencing objects generated by LutaML


There are two other commands that are used to refer to LutaML generated document elements:

* `lutaml_figure`. Provides a reference anchor to a figure defined in the XMI
  file, using its XMI ID for reference.

* `lutaml_table`. Provides a reference anchor to the definition tables of a
  particular package, class, enumeration or data type object in the XMI.


The syntax is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
// For lutaml_figure
This is lutaml_figure::[package="Wrapper root package", name="Fig B1 Full model"] figure

// For lutaml_table
This is lutaml_table::[package="Wrapper root package"] package
This is lutaml_table::[package="Wrapper root package", class="my name"] class
This is lutaml_table::[package="Wrapper root package", enum="my name"] enumeration
This is lutaml_table::[package="Wrapper root package", data_type="my name"] data type
----

This code will be transformed into `<<figure-{diagram.xmi_id}>>` and will point to diagram figure. One can only use this command when the document has rendered `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command as it needs diagram lookup table in order to reference package diagram.

Will produce this output:

[source,adoc]
----

=== Additional Information

text after CityGML package
----

In addition to the XMI file, this command also supports a YAML configuration file
that specifies:

* What packages to include in the render;

* What render style is desired;

* Location of the root package (which package should the iterative process start
  at);

* Which EA extensions to be loaded.

The format for using the YAML configuration file:

[source,yaml]
----
---
packages:
  # includes these packages
  - "Package *"
  - two*
  - three
  # skips these packages
  - skip: four
render_style: entity_list | data_dictionary | default
section_depth: 2
template_path: "path/to/custom/liquid/templates"
skip_unrecognized_connector: true
ea_extension:
  - "CityGML_MDG_Technology.xml"
  - "xmi_definition_for_some_standard.xml"
----

Where:

* `packages` - required, root element with the list of strings or objects

* `Package *` - pattern matching, specifies lookup condition for packages to
render.
+
NOTE: In this example, it is equal to the following regular expression: `/^Package.*$/`

* `skip: four` - object with package name to skip

* `render_style` - what template to use to render packages, can be one of:

** `entity_list`

** `data_dictionary`; or

** `default`

* `section_depth` - what package to use as root package for render.
e.g., a `section_depth` equal to `2` tells the processor to use the first
nested package of the first root packages in XMI file.
+
EXAMPLE: If the XMI file has this package structure, and we have `section_depth`
equal to 2, root package will be `one-1`.
+
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    name: 'One',
    packages: [{ name: 'one-1' }, { name: 'one-2' }]
  },
  {
    name: 'Two',
    packages: [{ name: 'two-1' }, { name: 'two-2' }]
  }
]
----

* `template_path` - optional, path to custom Liquid templates directory for
rendering the output. When specified, the processor will use custom templates
from this directory instead of the default built-in templates. This allows for
complete customization of the rendered output format and structure.

* `skip_unrecognized_connector` - optional, boolean flag that shows in liquid
templates as context variable `context.skip_unrecognized_connector`, which
allows to control whether the associations with unrecognized connectors should
be included in the output.  By making use of this context variable and
`association.connector.recognized?` in the liquid templates, you can
conditionally skip rendering of associations that have unrecognized connectors.
+
EXAMPLE: Given that `associations` is a list of association objects of a class
named `klass`, if you want to skip rendering of associations that have
unrecognized connectors when `skip_unrecognized_connector` is set to `true`,
then in the liquid template you can use:
+
[source,liquid]
----
{% for assoc in klass.associations %}
{% if context.skip_unrecognized_connector != true or assoc.connector.recognized? == true %}
...do something with association that has recognized connector...
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
----

* `ea_extension` - optional, list of EA extensions to load. Some XMI files may
contain elements that cannot be resolved by default, for example CityGML
elements.  You can use `ea_extension` to load the definition of these elements
in XML format (`CityGML_MDG_Technology.xml`) in order to resolve them.  The
location of the xml files is relative to the config YAML file.

Usage with command:

[source,adoc]
--
[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description, path/to/example.xmi, path/to/config.yml]
----
[.diagram_include_block, base_path="models/Images", format="png"]
...
...
----
--

The processor will read the supplied YAML config file (`path/to/config.yml`),
and iterate through packages according to the order supplied in the file. All
packages that match `skip` in the YAML config file will be skipped during
render.
